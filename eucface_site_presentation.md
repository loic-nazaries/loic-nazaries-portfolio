## Background

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated
with human activities are well known to be
the major contributors to climate change
worldwide as reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([IPCC, 2013](http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_ALL_FINAL.pdf "IPCC Report, 2013")).
These include:

- carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)
- methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)
- nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)

The [**Figure 1**](#Figure1) shows the huge increase in GHG concentration in the atmosphere since the beginning of the so-called « industrial revolution » which started onwards the middle of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.

**Figure 1**: Atmospheric concentrations of important greenhouse gases over the last 2,000 years.
Increases since about year 1750 are attributed to human activities in the industrial era. Concentration units are
parts per million (ppm) or parts per billion (ppb). Source:  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007).

While the concentration of these gases continue
to rise, forest ecosystems have been recently
proposed as a natural solution to climate
change (Griscom *et al.*, 2017 [[1]](#[[1]]);
Fargione *et al.*, 2018 [[2]](#[[2]])) because of their
significant capacity to sequestrate atmospheric
carbon (C) within the soil profile and
aboveground vegetation (Le Quéré *et al.*,
2018 [[3]](#[[3]])).

Past research has also revealed that current
atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels could increase by about
150 ppm before the year 2100 (Stocker *et al.*, 2013 [[4]](#[[4]]). The increase of CO<sub>2</sub> level in
the atmosphere is largely expected to promote
a greening effect (*i.e.* plant growth)
in forests globally, however, given the
concomitant expected global increase in
droughts and aridity levels, such CO<sub>2</sub>
fertilisation effect is under debate due to
increased water limitation feedback effects
(Brodribb *et al.*, 2020 [[5]](#[[5]]).

## The EucFACE Experiment

The *Eucalyptus* Free-Air CO<sub>2</sub> Enrichment
(EucFACE) experiment at Western Sydney
University, near Richmond, New South Wales,
Australia (33°37’S, 150°44’E, 23 m altitude)
represents a unique facility for studying the
effect of elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>
concentration on a remnant Cumberland Plain
Woodland. A detailed description of the site,
including vegetation and soil characteristics,
can be found elsewhere (Crous *et al.*, 2015
[[6]](#[[6]]); Drake *et al.*, 2016 [[7]](#[[7]]); Gimeno *et al.*, 2016 [[8]](#[[8]]).

The EucFACE is composed of six circular plots
(henceforth called “rings”), 25 m in diameter
and 28 m high. Mature old-growth
(> 75-year-old) *Eucalyptus tereticornis* is
the dominant species; however, the understorey
vegetation varies significantly between rings
(Hasegawa *et al.*, 2018 [[9]](#[[9]]).
Three rings are used as control and are
fumigated with ambient air (aCO<sub>2</sub>) while the
other three rings are fumigated with elevated
CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (eCO<sub>2</sub>). Fumigation with CO<sub>2</sub>
is set to 150 ppm above that of the control
rings (ambient + 150 ppm) in order to simulate
the climate prediction for the year 2100
(Stocker *et al.*, 2013 [[4]](#[[4]]). Fumigation
started in September 2012 with +30 ppm CO<sub>2</sub>
and was ramped periodically for six months
(+30 ppm every 4-5 weeks) until February 2013
(540 ppm).

## Aims & Hypotheses

Here, we conducted monthly measurements of
(*in situ*) net CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes from
May 2013 to June 2016 to investigate the
effects of elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (ambient
*vs*. +150 ppm) concentrations on soil net
CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes from a mature
Eucalypt woodland in New South Wales,
Australia. The *Eucalyptus* Free-Air CO<sub>2</sub>
Enrichment (EucFACE) experiment is a unique
research station established in 2012 in an
Australian endangered woodland ecosystem (the
Cumberland Plain).

The main aims of the present study were to:

1. Quantify the net CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes
under predicted elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (eCO<sub>2</sub>)
concentrations

2. Identify which climo-edaphic factors could
best predict soil GHG emissions

We considered three different alternative
hypotheses:

1. In mature forest, the feedback response of
GHG fluxes to eCO<sub>2</sub> will be minimal. The reason
is that in old forests, trees are not expected
to absorb large amount of CO<sub>2</sub> (*vs*. plant
growing phase), leading to reduced responses
for ecosystem processes such as gas emissions

2. The response (sink or production) of each
GHG investigated to eCO<sub>2</sub> treatment will differ,
with an expected increase of CO<sub>2</sub> and
N<sub>2</sub>O emissions while CH<sub>4</sub> flux rates will be
reduced

3. The magnitude of the GHG emissions will be
strongly linked to climo-edaphic properties,
such as rainfall events and soil water
availability as it is responsible for
regulating soil biological processes,
particularly in water-limited environments.

## Experimental Setup

### Greenhouse gas measurements

The collection of air samples for GHG analysis
was conducted monthly, from seven collars
permanently inserted into the ground,
within each ring. The GHG sampling campaigns
occurred over three years, between May 2013 to
June 2016 (no sampling took place in May 2015),
in a total of 37 monthly collections. More
details related to the sampling strategy can
be found in the supporting information
section.

The measurement of the net GHG fluxes between
soil and atmosphere was estimated using a
“static chamber method”, or non-flow-through
non-steady-state (Rochette & Eriksen-Hamel,
2008 [[10]](#[[10]]). Throughout the course of the
experiment (chamber design, sample collection
and analysis, data processing), guidelines from
de Klein *et al.* (2012) [[11]](#[[11]]) were followed.
Briefly, a 25 ml air sample was collected from
the chamber headspace (chamber characteristics:
diameter ≈ 20 cm; height above ground ≈ 11 cm;
headspace volume ≈ 5 L; soil insertion
depth ≈ 7 cm) during a 45-minute deployment
time and at four time points (tamb, t15, t30
and t45), see supporting information section
for further details. The concentrations of
CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> were detected on a gas
chromatography system against a seven-point
serial dilution of a GHG standard mixture
(5 ppm CH<sub>4</sub>, 600 ppm CO<sub>2</sub> and 1 ppm N<sub>2</sub>O).
Detailed gas chromatography system
characteristics and chamber design are in
supporting information.

The GHG concentrations were converted from
ppm values to mass-based concentrations using
a conversion factor derived from the ideal gas
law (PV = nRT), where an air pressure P of 1
atm was assumed and an universal gas constant
R of 0.082057 L atm K<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. After including
the chamber dimensions (headspace volume V,
chamber’s base area A) and the corresponding
molecular masses, the final flux units were
μg-C(N) m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> for CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O, and
mg-C m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> for CO<sub>2</sub>. Greenhouse gas fluxes
reported as negative represent net sinks
(flux from atmosphere to soil).
